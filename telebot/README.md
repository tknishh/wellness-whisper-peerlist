**Telegram:** But obvious the bot is running on Telegram, with beautiful interface.

**LangChain:**  The bot is trained on available conversational datasets from a real therapy session and books like the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and The Oxford Handbook of Psychiatry.
